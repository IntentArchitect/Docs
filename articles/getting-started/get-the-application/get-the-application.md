### Installation (macOS)

Simply open the `.dmg` file and drag Intent Architect into the Applications folder.

### Installation (Linux)

For Linux, we recommend downloading the [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) package format option which is able to run on any common Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc.).

Although not essential, the easiest way to use AppImages is to first install [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) which makes using AppImages seamless and also enables integration with your desktop environment, for example, it will "install" AppImages such that they appear in your desktop environment's list of Applications.

If you just want to run Intent Architect without "installing" it, you can just set the downloaded file to be executable by running `chmod a+x intent-architect*.AppImage` after which you can then run it.
