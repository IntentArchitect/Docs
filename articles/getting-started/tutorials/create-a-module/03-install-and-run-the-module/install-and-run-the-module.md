# Install and run the Module

When creating Modules it is often very useful to have a _test_ Application that we can use to test that our Modules are working correctly. This tutorial explains how to create this _test_ Application and how to install and run the Module we created in the [previous tutorial](xref:tutorials.create-a-module.create-a-simple-module).

## Create an empty Application

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already created an Application to install your module in, you can skip this section and jump straight to the [Install the Module](#install-the-module) section.

To get started, let's create an empty Application.

> [!TIP]
> Start a new instance of Intent Architect to create this application. It will make switching between your Modules Solution and the Test Application contexts very quick.

1. From the home view, click `Create a new application`.
2. Set the Application's name, location and Solution name. _NOTE: You can ignore which Application Template is selected. It won't affect an empty application._
3. Click `CREATE EMPTY` _NOTE: With `CREATE EMPTY` the selected application template is ignored)._
4. When prompted with a confirmation, click `YES` to continue.
5. Close the `Application Installation` dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> We typically create Applications with an [Application Template](xref:applications.how-to-create-application-templates). Empty Applications are useful when there aren't any Application Templates that fulfill your needs.

## Set up Visual Studio projects

Applications need a way to know where to output specific code files. Since we're working with .NET we can install the `Intent.VisualStudio.Projects` Module which installs a Designer to configure our .NET solution and project structure.

To install this module we must navigate to the `Modules` tab within our application.

1. Search for the `Intent.VisualStudio.Projects` Module by typing "visual" into the filter.
2. Select the Module.

3. In the details pane, Click `Install` to install the latest version.

4. Intent Architect will install the module and it's dependencies. Close the `Installation Manager` once it's finished.

You may have noticed that a new `Visual Studio` Designer was installed into our Application. It will allow us to structure the C# projects in our codebase. For this tutorial, we can set up a typical web application project structure which separates Domain, Infrastructure and Api concerns.

1. Click on the `Visual Studio` Designer
2. Create a new `Visual Studio Solution` package by clicking on the `CREATE NEW PACKAGE` button.
3. Fill in the name of the Visual Studio solution, then click `DONE`.
4. Next, create a set of projects by right-clicking on the new Visual Studio Solution package and selecting the project type. We will create an `ASP.NET Core Web Application` and two `Class Library (.NET Core)` projects in this tutorial.

    The application structure should look as follows:

    ![Create Projects](images/visual-studio-project-structure.png)
5. To create this project structure, run the Software Factory Execution. Intent Architect should stage the changes as follows:

6. Finally, click `APPLY CHANGES` to instruct Intent Architect to create the files in our codebase.

## Install the Module

Next, let's install the Module we created in the [previous step](xref:tutorials.create-a-module.create-a-simple-module). To do this we first navigate to the `Modules` tab of our Application.

### Finding and Installing the Module

By default Intent Architect is configured only with the repository for official Modules hosted at [https://intentarchitect.com/](https://intentarchitect.com/). To be able to use our own Module we can make the folder where our `MyModule.Entities` was created the default repository.

1. Open [User Settings](xref:how-to-guides.change-user-settings).
2. Add a new Repository with a unique `Name` (e.g. "My Modules") and the `Address` value being the full location of the folder where our Module was created (e.g. `C:\Dev\MyModules\Intent.Modules`).
3. Reorder the repositories so that this new one is at the top.
4. Click `Save`.

5. Select the new Repository from the Repositories dropdown. The `MyModules.Entities` Module should now show.
6. Install the Module.

### Assigning the Template Output

You may have noticed that the `Installation Manager` mentioned an _Unassigned template_ that was created.

![Selecting Repository and installing Module](images/unassigned-template-created-example.png)

This is important because it's telling us that we need to assign our `MyModules.Entities.EntityBase` template to an output location. This is done in the `Visual Studio` Designer.

1. Navigate to the `Visual Studio` Designer.
2. Drag the `MyModules.Entities.EntityBase` Template Output into the `TestApp.Domain` project.

    ![Assign Template Output](images/visual-studio-assign-template-output.gif)

We've now told Intent Architect that when generating our `EntityBase` template its output should be put in the `TestApp.Domain` project.

> [!NOTE]
> Assigning Template Outputs can be configured to happen automatically when we install a Module. We [use Roles to achieve this](xref:how-to-guides.auto-assign-template-outputs).

## Run the Module

We've created a project structure, installed our Module, and set the Output Target to our `TestApp.Domain` project. We're now ready to run our Module.

1. Run the [Software Factory Execution](xref:getting-started.take-a-tour#software-factory-execution). The following changes should be staged:

    ![Software Factory Output](images/software-factory-module-output.png)
2. Click the `APPLY CHANGES` button.
3. Open the codebase to verify that the new `EntityBase.cs` file was created in the correct location.

> [!NOTE]
> You may notice that a NuGet package (`Intent.RoslynWeaver.Attributes`) gets added to the `TestApp.Domain.csproj` file. This package provides _non-executing_ C# attributes which are used to instruct the [Code-Management](xref:getting-started.welcome#code-management) systems in C#. This is not a hard dependency, does not affect runtime execution in any way and can be swapped out or removed if needed.
