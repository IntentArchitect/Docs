## 1️⃣ Create a new solution

Start **Intent Architect** and click **Create New Solution**.  
Choose the **Clean Architecture template**, name your app (e.g., *MyShop*), and keep the default modules selected.

## 2️⃣ Generate your codebase

Run the **Software Factory** to stage and apply your first code generation.  
Intent Architect will create a full, working solution, no runtime dependencies, 100% standard .NET code.

## 3️⃣ Run and explore

Open the generated `.sln` in Visual Studio or Rider.  
Run the API project, open **Swagger**, and try out the customer endpoints.

You’ve just built a complete, architecture-aligned application with clean, deterministic code you can evolve.
