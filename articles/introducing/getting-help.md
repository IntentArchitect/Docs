## In-app help

Intent Architect includes a built-in help system to provide quick access to guidance and documentation.
You can open it by clicking the **blue question mark button in the top-right corner** of the window, or simply by pressing `F1`.

### Help dialog

Clicking the help button opens the **Help dialog**, which displays relevant help topics based on your currently installed modules. This includes context-specific documentation tailored to the currently selected element and open designer. You'll also find quick links to contact support or open the main Intent Architect documentation website.

You can browse through the suggested topics or use the **search box** to look up keywords. When searching, **all available documentation** is included — even topics from modules that aren’t currently installed. This makes it easy to discover additional features and functionality you might want to add to your application.

> [!NOTE]
> The Help dialog is **context-aware** by default, showing topics related to the currently active designer and selected elements.  
> Use the search box to explore beyond your current context or to discover features from other modules.
