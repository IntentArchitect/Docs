# Codebase Integration

## Overview

Intent Architect integrates directly with your existing development workflow and IDE, augmenting your current development experience with automation.  

Unlike typical code generation tools that simply scaffold or are inflexible to customization, Intent Architect‚Äôs integration model is built around **transparency, precision, and developer choice**.  You decide which parts of your code are automated, which are hand-crafted, and how the two coexist, all with full review and traceability.

At its core, this is powered by three systems: **Code Management**, **Customization Tracking**, and **Developer-in-the-Loop Integration** through the **Software Factory**.

## Key Benefits

- **üß© Code Management**  
  Define exactly which parts of your code are managed by Intent Architect and which remain developer-controlled.  
  Fine-grained configuration, from entire files down to individual statements, ensures automation never interferes with your code.

- **üß≠ Customization Tracking**  
  Track and visualize every architectural deviation.  
  See what‚Äôs been customized, by whom, and why ‚Äî bringing accountability and clarity to design evolution.

- **üíª IDE Integration & Review**  
  Work side-by-side with your IDE.  
  Visual models link directly to the codebase, and every change is presented as a diff for review before it‚Äôs applied.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Unified Generation Pipeline**  
  Deterministic (pattern-based) and AI-assisted code generation share the same transparent process ‚Äî reviewable, reversible, and developer-controlled.

| **Architecture opt-out model** | Standards are enforced by default; deviations are intentional, visible, and tracked. |

| **Staging & review (Software Factory)** | Every change is proposed as a diff for developer approval before applying, automation with full control. |

| **Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Generation** | Combines versioned, repeatable templates with AI-assisted generation, both governed and traceable within the same pipeline. |
| **Augments your IDE** | Works seamlessly alongside Visual Studio or Rider, complementing your existing workflow. |
 **Developer-in-the-loop** ‚Äî every proposed change is presented as a diff for review and approval before it touches your source.  
- **Non-deterministic (AI-assisted) code generation** ‚Äî Intent Architect can use architectural context to guide an LLM for ‚Äúprompt-less‚Äù AI interactions.
