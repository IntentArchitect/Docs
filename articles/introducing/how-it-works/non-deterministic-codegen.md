# AI-Assisted Code Generation

## Overview

While Pattern-Based Code Generation automates predictable patterns, some parts of software development require creative, context-aware logic that can’t be fully predefined.  
**Intent Architect’s AI-Assisted Code Generation** bridges that gap with **AI Accelerators**, guided tools that can implement Blazor views, service implementations, unit tests, and other non-deterministic components directly from your architectural design.

Unlike traditional AI coding tools that rely on hand-crafted prompts and unpredictable output, Intent Architect performs all **context engineering** automatically. It builds structured, detailed prompts from your blueprints, ensuring that AI generation aligns with your architecture.  

Developers remain fully in control: AI-suggested changes are presented as diffs allowing review, iteration, and safe application.

## Key Benefits

- **🧠 Promptless, Predictable AI Experience**  
  Intent Architect automatically constructs detailed prompts from your architectural model, turning AI coding into a repeatable, deterministic process.

- **⚙️ Non-Deterministic Automation**  
  Use AI to generate complex logic or creative code that traditional pattern-based automation can’t predict.

- **🛡️ Developer-in-the-Loop Control**  
  Every AI-generated suggestion appears as a code diff, ensuring complete transparency and safety before applying.

- **🔄 Choose Your LLM**  
  Integrate with your preferred model(s), OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, or others.

## AI Accelerators

## Pick your favourite LLM


AI tools can be unpredictable and prompt-heavy. <strong>Intent Architect integrates AI with guardrails</strong>, constructs architectural context automatically, and converts results into reviewable diffs,  enabling deterministic, repeatable, prompt-less generation that’s developer-controlled.

### Deterministic AI

AI tools accelerate development, but in practice, results are unpredictable, unrepeatable, and often require tedious prompt crafting.  
**Intent Architect integrates AI with guardrails** — it automatically constructs architectural context for the LLM of your choice and converts results into reviewable diffs. The result is **deterministic, safe, repeatable AI-assisted generation** that’s prompt-less and developer-controlled.
