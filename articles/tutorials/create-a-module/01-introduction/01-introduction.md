# Creating modules (.NET) introduction

This guide will walk you through creating a [Module](xref:reference/module) with a focus on functionality especially applicable C# and .NET.


## Prerequisites

- [Intent Architect](https://intentarchitect.com/#/downloads).
- An IDE capable of working with .NET Core projects and able to pre-compile `.tt` files, such as [Visual Studio for Windows or Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- If you're using Visual Studio 2019 for Windows, we recommend installing an extension to add syntax highlighting support for `.tt` files, such as [tangible T4 Editor](https://t4-editor.tangible-engineering.com/T4-Editor-Visual-T4-Editing.html).
