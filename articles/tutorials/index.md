# Tutorials

We try to help you understand Intent Architect as a newcomer by providing a couple of tutorials to work through.
Please choose the one that closely relates to the feature you're trying to learn.

### [Getting Started - Create an ASP.NET Core web app](create-an-aspnetcore-web-app.md)
Let us show you how easy it is to create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application using Intent Architect and have it up and running in 5 minutes.

### [Create your own Module](create-your-own-module.md)
Once you have understood that one of the powerful features of Intent Architect comes from selecting modules, you will love the fact that you can create your own. This tutorial will take you through the process of creating your own ASP.NET Web API based code generation module.

### [Making a Template able to support extensibility through Decorators](make-template-extensible-through-decorators.md)
You will notice that templates are quite static in nature. If you have created a template that generates a file for a specific technology configuration, you will have to update the template again if you want to add another kind of technology configuration. We will show you how to overcome this by using Decorators.

### [Creating a Decorator](create-decorator.md)
Once you have a Template that is able to receive Decorators, you can now go and create your technology dependent Decorator that will inject code during code-generation time to your file that you wish to generate.
