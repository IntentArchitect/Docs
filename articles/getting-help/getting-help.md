# Getting help

## Built-in help

Intent Architect provides a comprehensive built-in help system to assist you when you need guidance or documentation. Access the help feature by clicking the blue question mark button located in the top-right corner of the application window, or simply press F1.

### Help dialog

This opens a Help dialog that displays relevant help topics provided by your installed modules, along with options to contact support or visit the main Intent Architect documentation website. You can easily find the information you need by scrolling through the available topics or using the search box to filter results based on keywords.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Help Topics are context aware. Depending on the current open designer page you will be presented with different Help Topics.
