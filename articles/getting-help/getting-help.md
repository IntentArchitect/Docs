# Getting help

## Help for modules

When looking at the details of a module, they may optionally have "release notes" and/or a "Project URL":

Pressing "release notes" will show the changes to a module broken down by the version in which those changes were introduced:

Pressing the "Project URL" will open the link in your default web browser. These links  contain documentation on the particular module:
