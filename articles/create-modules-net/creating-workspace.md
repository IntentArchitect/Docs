# Creating a Workspace

This tutorial serves as a stepping stone for the ones to follow where we will ultimately create and install a custom Module on this Workspace for us to test that our Module works.

We will explore and explain each concept as we encounter them but for now, let's get out Workspace ready.

## Prerequisites

This guide has the following prerequisites:
 - Intent Architect is currently only supported on Windows OS and MacOS
 - (Windows) Windows 8.1 or later with Visual Studio 2017 (with .NET Core 2.1 SDK) or later.
 - (MacOS) 10.10 (Yosemite) or later with Visual Studio for Mac.

{ explain the whole setup from here... }
