# About Decorators

Decorators are a mechanism which can be used by Templates in order to inject content at certain _hook points_ within a Template. Templates expose a `Decorator contract` which can be implemented by Decorators in different modules. In this way Templates can be extended by modules on which they have no dependency and might have been created by completely different authors or even companies.
