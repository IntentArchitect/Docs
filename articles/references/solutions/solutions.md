# Solutions

Solutions in Intent Architect serve as a _view_ on one or more [Applications](xref:references.applications). They have some basic settings and can configure which Repositories are available for the Applications.

An Application can only be opened in the context on a Solution, which is represented by an `.isln` (Intent Solution) file on the disk-drive.

Additional Applications can be created from the Solution dashboard by clicking on the `Create new application...` button. Applications can also be filtered as well as _favourited_ by clicking the _Star_ in the top right-hand of an Application. They can be removed by right-clicking and selecting the `Delete` option.
