# Notations

This section will cover the various notations that we are using in Intent Architect for specifying certain values.

## Version Ranges

You might have come across a version specification looking like this: `[3.0.0,4.0.0)`.

It is very similar to the [mathematical interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals) where the `[`, `]` (square bracket) characters indicate inclusivity, while the `(`, `)` (parenthesis) indicate exclusivity.
So starting with a `[` character means that the number that follows will be included in the range check and a number that exists right before the last `)` will indicate the end of the range without the number itself.

This is how Intent Architect denotes how to interpret version numbers when determining whether if a given component is compatible with another component. For instance, a Module might be built for a given version of Intent Architect which is guaranteed to be compatible. A future version may have a different API exposed which might not be compatible with this Module and therefore the Module might instruct Intent Architect that if the version of Intent Architect is 3.0.0 (or above) **AND** just below 4.0.0, it will be deemed compatible.
