# Module Builder

The Module Builder is one of the powerful features of Intent Architect which allows a developer to craft their own code-generation module. This will allow a developer to generate custom defined code at the click of a button once that module is installed (while its being Intent Architect Managed). Think of the power!

>[!NOTE]
>The scope of this article is to explain the concepts found in the Module Builder. If you wish to find out more about Modules or Templates themselves, please navigate to the relevant section on the panel to the left.
