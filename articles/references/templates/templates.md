remarks: |
    For now this is covered by the `Templates C#` doc, but ultimately
    generalized content will be extracted from there into this and that will
    become a sub-node of this menu item

    This file will take generalized concepts from the C# template, it will also
    be an expandable node on the left with things like the C# template as a
    sub-node.
