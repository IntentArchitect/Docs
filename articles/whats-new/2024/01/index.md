### OData Query support

This modules adds OData Query support to your CQRS paradigm service end points, specifically `Query`s.

For more detail, refer to the [module documentation](https://github.com/IntentArchitect/Intent.Modules.NET/blob/development/Modules/Intent.Modules.AspNetCore.ODataQuery/README.md).

Available from:

- Intent.AspNetCore.ODataQuery 1.0.0-beta.*

### C# Code Management statement block merging improvements

Improvements have been made to code management within statement blocks.

- For most statement types, old statements will now be removed from existing files when a template's output has changed.
- Instead of using `// [IntentMatch("…")]` above statements to control how they match with a statement generated by a template, one should now use the more intuitive `// [IntentFully(Match = "…")]` or `// [IntentIgnore(Match = "…")]` instructions.

For more information on controlling statement code management behaviour, refer to [our Docs article](https://docs.intentarchitect.com/articles/application-development/code-management/code-management-csharp/code-management-csharp.html#block-statement-code-management-behaviour).

Available from:

- Intent.OutputManager.RoslynWeaver 4.4.0

### RabbitMQ Trigger for Azure Functions added

We have made an improvement on the Azure Functions module, which now includes the ability to select RabbitMQ Triggers for queue integration. This feature allows developers to create functions that are triggered by messages in a RabbitMQ queue, providing a seamless integration between Azure Functions and RabbitMQ.
