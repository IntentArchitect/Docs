### Improved VS Solution modeling options

You can now explicitly configure the following:

- VS Solutions name, as opposed to defaulting to the package name.
- Specify a relative location for the VS Solution, easily move the solution file or shared a solution between applications.

You can also choose to have solution folder realized as actual folders in your VS Solution using the `Folder Options` stereotype and checking `Materialize Folder`.

### Infrastructure as Code with Terraform Module

This module automatically generates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Terraform `.tf` files for your Intent Architect applications.

The module scans all applications in your Intent Architect Solution to identify Azure Function applications and generates the necessary Terraform configuration to deploy them to Azure, including integration with Azure Event Grid and Service Bus when the respective modules are installed.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to introduce Terraform as a new application in your solution through the `Terraform Infrastructure Provisioning` application template.

...

resource "azurerm_windows_function_app" "azure_service_bus_app1_function_app" {
  name                       = local.azure_service_bus_app1_app_name

### Request payload logging improvements

For MediatR pipeline behaviors you can control whether request payload logging occurs by configuring the `CqrsSettings:LogRequestPayload` setting.

Additionally there is a `BoundedLoggingDestructuringPolicy` class introduced for Serilog to log any object without causing any excessive logging to take place. It does this by:

1. Limiting collection sizes.
2. Truncating objects with too many properties.
3. Replacing problematic property types (like streams and byte arrays) with placeholders.
4. Handling exceptions during property access to prevent logging failures.

This policy helps maintain logging performance by controlling the size of log events and preventing runaway memory consumption from large object graphs.

Available from:

- Intent.Application.MediatR.Behaviours 4.3.3
- Intent.Modules.AspNetCore.Logging.Serilog 5.3.0
