## Special usages

### Create new element of selected type

When on an element the `Ctrl + Enter` shortcut can be used to make a new element of the same type, this can be very useful when needing to create lots of elements of the same type, for example domain class attributes or DTO fields.

For example, while having typed in the name of an element, before having even pressed enter to complete the change:
