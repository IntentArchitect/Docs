The principles that Intent Architect embodies are the future of software development.

Intent Architect allows developers to describe their applications at a higher level using specialized models, and then choose how to realize these models into tangible source code. In a traditional sense this is a form of model-driven engineering (MDE), but with a unique and practical approach. In another sense, Intent Architect is a new flavour of _low-code_ technology - one that can actually scale and has no lock-in.

Intent Architect is a paradigm shift from traditional software development.  

Intent Architect effectively alleviates these causes by allowing developers to describe their systems at a higher level, and then allowing them to choosing how these descriptions are realized into tangible code. It then intelligently manages this code for the developer so that it can be easily changed at a later stage. While source-code generation using high-level models is not a new concept, the unique way in which Intent Architect does it has many benefits.
