{Welcome message}

{Please note all the original articles are renamed to have a postfix of `.archive`}

{I'm using these curly braces for draft comments for now, feel free to delete once you tackle that section}

{I would like to ask that we try and retain the ideas from [this](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) as much as we can, please}

## [Overview of Intent Architect](articles/overview/index.md)
{Link to page where Gareth can post an overview of Intent}

## [Tutorials](articles/tutorials/index.md)
We learn best by example. Intent Architect offers tutorials for helping new comers getting started.
> ### [Series: Create an Intent Module](articles/tutorials/create-intent-module-series.md)
> This is a short series that explains how to extend Intent Architect so that you can use your own custom code to automate the code being generated for your project.

## [How-to guides](articles/howtos/index.md)
{Resolving types, stereotype usage, filtering templates, output location control, etc.}

## [Reference documentation](articles/references/index.md)
{Probably not for now but some concept explanation and API docs will be useful here}

## [Topic guides](articles/topics/index.md)
{Unless we get a blog, this is a good place to put articles that relate to Intent but are beyond Intent}

{There is one article in here so long}
