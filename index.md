# Intent Architect docs

Welcome to the Intent Architect docs. All docs are generated from the source files in our [Docs Github Repository](https://github.com/IntentSoftware/Docs).

## Where do I start?

A good place to start is our [welcome](articles/getting-started/welcome/welcome.md) doc.

<script type="text/javascript">
  let prefix = window.location.pathname.toLowerCase() === "/docs" ? "/docs/" : "";
  window.location.href = `${prefix}articles/getting-started/welcome/welcome.html`;
</script>

## What if I find an issue with a particular doc or have a suggestion?

If you're familiar with markdown, Github and are happy to fix small issues yourself, we welcome pull requests. All docs have an `Improve this Doc` link at the top right of the page which can be clicked on to take you right to the doc source.

The next best for us if you [create an issue](https://github.com/IntentSoftware/Docs/issues/new/choose) on the Github repository.

Otherwise, feel free to hit us up on other pre-established communication channel you already have with us.
